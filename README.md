# Newletter Backend
## Objectives: 
1. To design and implement an online newsletter subscription service provider.
2. To learn and understand the working, internals and the solution that each of the technologies (which will be used in the stack) provide.

## Product Specification: 
1. Building an online newsletter subscription (Letâ€™s take Times of India or TOI newsletter for instance). 
2. There are multiple subscriptions to choose from. A user should be able to choose multiple subscriptions.
3. A subscription can be searched, sorted and filtered based on some parameters.
4. Each subscription for a user comes with few attributes. They have a subscription price, a time period of subscription and their ability to be renewed at any time by the user.
5. A user on the platform is identified by an email Id and they receive the newsletters via their email only. Every user should be able to have their own login accounts and access their subscriptions. The subscriptions can be cancelled, renewed and subscribed to only if the user is logged in.
